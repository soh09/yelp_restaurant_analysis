# yelp_restaurant_analysis
I performed EDA on the yelp businesses dataset, exclusively focusing on restaurants.
I attempted to find correlation between the popularity of a certain type of cuisine (measured in average stars of restaurants that serve that kind of cuisine) in a given US/CA state and the concentration of that ethnic population in the state. Overall, theres was a slight negative correlation between the popularity and the population concentration (ie if there was a high concentration of Asians in a state, tha Asian restaurants in that state tended to have lower average ratings).
